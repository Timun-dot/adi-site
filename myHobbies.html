                <h2>My Hobbies!</h2>
                <p>My Hobbies are playing online games and movies. Whenever I have a free time or I've finish all of my assignment I will spend time doing my Hobbies so that I can reduce my stress from doing assignment. It is very important to have a hobby so that we can at least enjoy doing what we loved and maybe it can turn into career.</p>

                <h2>Online Games</h2>
                <p>This is my all time favourite hobbies since I was in primary school! I started by playing video games such as playstation 1 and now I have playstation 4 but when I 18 years old I started playing mobile games such as PUBGM and Mobile Legend. Besides, I also joined a lot of competition!.</p>
